| Offhand Attack, {{name=Offhand Attack&#125;&#125; {{source= [DnDBeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/combat#TwoWeaponFighting)&#125;&#125; {{description=When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand&#44; you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack&#44; unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property&#44; you can throw the weapon&#44; instead of making a melee attack with it.&#125;&#125;
| Cast a Spell, {{name=Cast a Spell&#125;&#125; {{source= [Open5e](https://open5e.com/combat/actions-in-combat)&#125;&#125; {{description=Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics&#44; as well as many monsters&#44; have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time&#44; which specifies whether the caster must use an action&#44; a reaction&#44; minutes&#44; or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is&#44; therefore&#44; not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action&#44; so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.&#125;&#125;
| Bardic Inspiration, {{name=Bardic Inspiration&#125;&#125; {{source= [Open5e](https://open5e.com/classes/bard)&#125;&#125; {{description=You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so&#44; you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die&#44; a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes&#44; the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check&#44; attack roll&#44; or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die&#44; but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled&#44; it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level&#44; a d10 at 10th level&#44; and a d12 at 15th level. &#125;&#125;}
