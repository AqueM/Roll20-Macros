| Offhand Attack, {{name=Offhand Attack&#125;&#125; {{source= [DnDBeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/combat#TwoWeaponFighting)&#125;&#125; {{description=When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand&#44; you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack&#44; unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property&#44; you can throw the weapon&#44; instead of making a melee attack with it.&#125;&#125;
| Cast a Spell, {{name=Cast a Spell&#125;&#125; {{source= [Open5e](https://open5e.com/combat/actions-in-combat)&#125;&#125; {{description=Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics&#44; as well as many monsters&#44; have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time&#44; which specifies whether the caster must use an action&#44; a reaction&#44; minutes&#44; or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is&#44; therefore&#44; not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action&#44; so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.&#125;&#125;}
