## Optionally you can create two Attributes (created similarly as Abilities) in the Character sheet
## senses : type your darkvision etc. here
## resistances : type your resistances here

## Without these, Senses and Resistance will simply display "selected|senses" and "selected|resistances" respectively. You can create these Attributes and leave them blank for a prettier output.

## Inspired by a Macro from u/ERock_GM at Reddit
