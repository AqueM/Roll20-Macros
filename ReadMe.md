## What is this
A collection of my macros for roll20 DnD 5e games. Some are based on other people's macro collections, some are made from scratch by me.

## How to use this
Files are divided into three types: Abilities which you add to a Character sheet, Macros which can be run anytime, and Token Actions that require a Token to be selected to work. Follow the right directions to add them.

### Add a Macro or Token Action
- Open your desired game. 
- Go to Collections>Macros>+Add
- Paste the text from a desired file into the Actions field
- Type a unique name into the Name field. 
- Optionally: Check "Show as Token Action" to show it in top left of the screen when a Token is selected
- Click Save Changes
- Optionally: Check "In Bar" next to the created Macro to show it at all times at the bottom of the screen

### Add an Ability
- Open your desired game
- Open a Character Sheet
- Go to Attributes & Abilities tab
- Click +Add on the right, next to Abilities
- Scroll to the bottom of the Abilities list and click the pencil icon next to the last Ability (probably named "New Ability 0")
- Paste the text from a desired file into the Actions field
- Type a unique name into the Name field
- Click Checkmark icon next to the Name field to save changes
- Optionally: Check "Show in Macro Bar" under the created Ability to always show it as "Character name: Ability name" at the bottom of the screen
- Optionally: Check "Show as Token Action" to show it in top left of the screen when a Token is selected
