## This is functionally the same to dragging the Initiavite Check from the Character Sheet to the Macro Bar manually, but it allows you to have it as a Token Action instead of cluttering the Macro Bar
## Only works as Macro (not Ability). Suggested to add as a Token Action only. Will break if the character has an Ability called Initiative.
