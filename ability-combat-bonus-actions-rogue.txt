| Offhand Attack, {{name=Offhand Attack&#125;&#125; {{source= [DnDBeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/combat#TwoWeaponFighting)&#125;&#125; {{description=When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand&#44; you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack&#44; unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property&#44; you can throw the weapon&#44; instead of making a melee attack with it.&#125;&#125;
| Cast a Spell, {{name=Cast a Spell&#125;&#125; {{source= [Open5e](https://open5e.com/combat/actions-in-combat)&#125;&#125; {{description=Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics&#44; as well as many monsters&#44; have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time&#44; which specifies whether the caster must use an action&#44; a reaction&#44; minutes&#44; or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is&#44; therefore&#44; not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action&#44; so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.&#125;&#125;
| Dash, {{name=Dash&#125;&#125; {{source= [Open5e](https://open5e.com/combat/actions-in-combat)&#125;&#125; {{description=When you take the Dash action&#44; you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed&#44; after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet&#44; for example&#44; you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet&#44; for instance&#44; you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.&#125;&#125;
| Disengage, {{name=Disengage&#125;&#125; {{source= [Open5e](https://open5e.com/combat/actions-in-combat)&#125;&#125; {{description=If you take the Disengage action&#44; your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.&#125;&#125;
| Hide, {{name=Hide&#125;&#125; {{source= [Open5e](https://open5e.com/combat/actions-in-combat)&#125;&#125; {{description=When you take the Hide action&#44; you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide&#44; following the rules for hiding. If you succeed&#44; you gain certain benefits&#44; as described in srd:unseen-attackers-and-targets.&#125;&#125;
| Use an Object (Thief), {{name=Use an Object&#125;&#125; {{source= [Open5e](https://open5e.com/combat/actions-in-combat)&#125;&#125; {{description=You normally interact with an object while doing something else&#44; such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use&#44; you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.&#125;&#125; }
