&{template:traits&#125; {{name=Exhaustion&#125;&#125; {source= [Open5e](https://open5e.com/conditions/exhaustion)&#125;&#125; {{description=Some special abilities and environmental hazards&#44; such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures&#44; can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion&#44; as specified in the effect's description.
If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion&#44; its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example&#44; a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description&#44; with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1&#44; provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.&#125;&#125;
